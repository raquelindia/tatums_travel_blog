          Today we went to see the Eiffel Tower. It was every bit amazing as people say it is. We climbed all the way to the top, and we were exhausted when we got there.  We bought some very expensive water and pastries, but at least the bathroom was included.

          This arch is huge!  I can't believe they built this just to celebrate a victory.  And it's still standing today!  In the middle of a very crazy roundabout.  Gee, I'm glad there's a tunnel to it.
